# Lightcast/EMSI Reports
This is the template for building Lightcast/EMSI reports. These reports are requested on a semi-regular basis and it can be useful to have a template to follow. Feel free to make modifications as needed or desired, but this should be a useful first-step. It is important to recognize that these reports are extremely high-level and often lack in nuance. 

There are 6 broad steps that must be taken:
## Step 1: Identify CIP codes
The first step is to identify the CIP codes associated with the program you are anlyizing. Sometimes units will have feedback on this point, but typically they will not. There are generally two good resources to use: a) the list of programs from the University Factbook (https://itableau.du.edu/#/views/AcademicPrograms/AcademicPrograms). b) The NCES website (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/Default.aspx?y=56). The Lightcast program evaluation tool will also allow you search for CIP codes based on program keywords.

## Step 2: Identify SOC codes
You will also need to identify the associated SOC codes. Again, there are three typical ways of determining this: a) the O\*Net website (https://www.onetonline.org/) b) the CIP-SOC crosswalk provided by Lightcast c) keyword searches in Lightcast. The SOC codes will sometimes be useful for evaluating the labor market, but often times they are not terribly informative.

## Step 3: Run Lightcast report

## Step 4: Download CIP code data

## Step 5: Process downloaded data with the python script

## Step 6: Create visuales

## Step 7: Create Report

## Step 8: Write Summary

## Step 9: Proof
