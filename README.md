# Lightcast/EMSI Reports
This is the template for building Lightcast/EMSI reports. These reports are requested on a semi-regular basis and it can be useful to have a template to follow. Feel free to make modifications as needed or desired, but this should be a useful first-step. It is important to recognize that these reports are extremely high-level and often lack in nuance. 

There are 6 broad steps that must be taken:
## Step 1: Identify CIP codes

## Step 2: Identify SOC codes

## Step 3: Run Lightcast report

## Step 4: Download CIP code data

## Step 5: Process downloaded data with the python script

## Step 6: Create vizuales

## Step 7: Create Report

## Step 8: Write Summary

## Step 9: Proof
